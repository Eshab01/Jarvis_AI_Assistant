## üîß Step-by-Step Setup Guide

```bash
python -m venv jarvis_env
```
Activate the environment:
- **Windows:** `jarvis_env\Scripts\activate`
- **Linux/Mac:** `source jarvis_env/bin/activate`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Essential Python Libraries (Install via pip)
Copy-paste the following command to install all required packages:

Alternatively, you can install packages one by one:

```bash
pip install g4f
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install psutil
pip install textblob
pip install schedule
pip install pydub
pip install pygame
```

If `dlib` or `face_recognition` fails, try this:
```bash
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Tools
For full functionality:
- Install **ffmpeg** (needed for `pydub`) from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Jarvis
After installation, run the assistant with:
```bash
python jarvis.py
```

## üî• Troubleshooting
- If any module fails to install, ensure `pip` is up to date:
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
- For missing module errors, rerun the install commands.
